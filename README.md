# Introduction 
This project involves the development of a deep learning-based classification system for detecting and diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) from medical images, such as chest X-rays (CXR). The system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning architecture highly effective for image recognition and classification tasks.
